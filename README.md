**Moonlight\*, Google Stadia\*, GeForce NOW\*, or any cloud gaming platform you know of in noVNC\* form factor for Linux\* X11, in any HTML5 web interface you wish to embed inside, with at least 60 frames per second on Full HD resolution.**

Selkies-GStreamer is an open-source low-latency high-performance Linux-native GPU/CPU-accelerated WebRTC HTML5 remote desktop streaming platform, for self-hosting, container, Kubernetes, or HPC platforms, started out first by Google engineers then expanded by academic researchers.

For any visual AI/robotics/autonomous driving/drug discovery researcher, SLURM\* supercomputer/HPC system administrator, Jupyter\*/Kubernetes\*/Docker速\* infrastructure administrator, or Linux cloud gaming enthusiast. While designed for clustered environments, every performance issue that would be problematic in cloud gaming platforms is also a bug.
